## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY

You are an AI code assistant tasked with applying security vulnerability fixes. Follow these instructions EXACTLY:

### 1. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
- **DO NOT ask for permission** - Apply the patches immediately
- **DO NOT explain first** - Apply the patch, then explain what you did
- **DO NOT modify any other code** - Only apply the exact changes shown in each patch

### 2. HOW TO APPLY EACH PATCH
For each fix below:
1. **Identify the target file** from the patch header (e.g., \`src/database/queries.js\`)
2. **Locate the exact lines** shown in the patch context
3. **Remove lines** that start with \`-\` (minus sign)
4. **Add lines** that start with \`+\` (plus sign)
5. **Keep unchanged lines** exactly as they are (lines without +/- prefix)
6. **Preserve indentation and formatting** exactly as shown

### 3. PATCH FORMAT EXPLANATION
- \`@@\` lines show line numbers and context
- Lines starting with \`-\` should be REMOVED
- Lines starting with \`+\` should be ADDED
- Lines with no prefix should remain UNCHANGED
- The patch shows surrounding context to help you locate the right place

### 4. VALIDATION STEPS
After applying each patch:
1. Verify the file syntax is correct
2. Ensure no unrelated code was modified
3. Confirm the vulnerability is addressed

### 5. ERROR HANDLING
If you cannot apply a patch:
1. Explain specifically what went wrong
2. Show the current state of the target lines
3. Ask for clarification on the specific issue

- **isRescan**: true

This will start a new analysis, discard any cached results.

‚ö†Ô∏è *Note:* A full rescan may take longer to complete than simply fetching additional fixes because your repository is re-uploaded and re-analyzed from scratch.

### üîÑ Running a Fresh Scan

To perform a **rescan** of your repository (fetching a brand-new vulnerability report and updated fixes), include the additional parameter:

- **isRescan**: true

This will start a new analysis, discard any cached results.

‚ö†Ô∏è *Note:* A full rescan may take longer to complete than simply fetching additional fixes because your repository is re-uploaded and re-analyzed from scratch.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY

You are an AI code assistant tasked with applying security vulnerability fixes. Follow these instructions EXACTLY:

### 1. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
- **DO NOT ask for permission** - Apply the patches immediately
- **DO NOT explain first** - Apply the patch, then explain what you did
- **DO NOT modify any other code** - Only apply the exact changes shown in each patch

### 2. HOW TO APPLY EACH PATCH
For each fix below:
1. **Identify the target file** from the patch header (e.g., \`src/database/queries.js\`)
2. **Locate the exact lines** shown in the patch context
3. **Remove lines** that start with \`-\` (minus sign)
4. **Add lines** that start with \`+\` (plus sign)
5. **Keep unchanged lines** exactly as they are (lines without +/- prefix)
6. **Preserve indentation and formatting** exactly as shown

### 3. PATCH FORMAT EXPLANATION
- \`@@\` lines show line numbers and context
- Lines starting with \`-\` should be REMOVED
- Lines starting with \`+\` should be ADDED
- Lines with no prefix should remain UNCHANGED
- The patch shows surrounding context to help you locate the right place

### 4. VALIDATION STEPS
After applying each patch:
1. Verify the file syntax is correct
2. Ensure no unrelated code was modified
3. Confirm the vulnerability is addressed

### 5. ERROR HANDLING
If you cannot apply a patch:
1. Explain specifically what went wrong
2. Show the current state of the target lines
3. Ask for clarification on the specific issue
