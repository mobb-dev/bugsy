      "description": "Scans a given local repository for security vulnerabilities and returns auto-generated code fixes.

When to invoke:
• Use when the user explicitly asks to "scan for vulnerabilities", "run a security check", or "test for security issues" in a local repository.
• The repository must exist on disk; supply its absolute path with the required "path" argument.
• Ideal after the user makes code changes (added/modified/staged files) but before committing, or whenever they request a full rescan.

How to invoke:
• Required argument:
  – path (string): absolute path to the repository root.
• Optional arguments:
  – offset (number): pagination offset used when the result set is large.
  – limit (number): maximum number of fixes to include in the response.
  – rescan (boolean): true to force a complete rescan even if cached results exist.

Behaviour:
• If the directory is not a valid Git repository, the tool falls back to scanning recently changed files in the folder.
• By default, only new, modified, or staged files are scanned; if none are found, it checks recently changed files.
• The tool NEVER commits or pushes changes; it only returns proposed diffs/fixes as text.

Return value:
The response is an object with a single "content" array containing one text element. The text is either:
• A human-readable summary of the fixes / patches, or
• A diagnostic or error message if the scan fails or finds nothing to fix.

      "description": "Check the MOBB backend for pre-generated fixes (patch sets) that correspond to vulnerabilities detected in the supplied Git repository.

Use when:
• You already have a local clone of a Git repository and want to know if MOBB has fixes available for it.
• A vulnerability scan has been run previously and uploaded to the MOBB backend and you want to fetch the list or count of ready-to-apply fixes before triggering a full scan-and-fix flow.

Required argument:
• path – absolute path to the local Git repository clone.

Optional arguments:
• offset – pagination offset (integer).
• limit  – maximum number of fixes to return (integer).

The tool will:
1. Validate that the provided path is secure and exists.
2. Verify that the directory is a valid Git repository with an "origin" remote.
3. Query the MOBB service by the origin remote URL and return a textual summary of available fixes (total and by severity) or a message if none are found.

Call this tool instead of scan_and_fix_vulnerabilities when you only need a fixes summary and do NOT want to perform scanning or code modifications.",
