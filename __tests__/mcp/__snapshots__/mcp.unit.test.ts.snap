"üîç **MOBB SECURITY SCAN STATUS**

## No Vulnerability Report Found

We were unable to find a previous vulnerability report for this repository. This could be due to several reasons:

### üìã Possible Reasons
- This is a new repository that hasn't been scanned yet
- The repository URL might not match our records
- The repository might be private or not accessible
- Previous scans might have been deleted or expired

### üéØ Recommended Actions
1. **Run a new security scan** to analyze your codebase
   - Use the \`fix_vulnerabilities\` tool to start a fresh scan
   - This will analyze your current code for security issues

2. **Verify repository access**
   - Ensure the repository is properly connected to Mobb
   - Check that you have the necessary permissions

3. **Check repository URL**
   - Confirm the repository URL matches your remote origin
   - Verify the URL format is correct (e.g., https://github.com/org/repo)

### üöÄ Next Steps
To get started with security scanning:
1. Run \`fix_vulnerabilities\` to perform a new scan
2. Review the results and apply any suggested fixes
3. Set up regular scanning to maintain security

### üí° Additional Information
- New scans typically take a few minutes to complete
- You'll receive detailed results including:
  - Vulnerability types and severities
  - Specific code locations
  - Recommended fixes
  - Security best practices

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY

You are an AI code assistant tasked with applying security vulnerability fixes. Follow these instructions EXACTLY:

### 1. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
- **DO NOT ask for permission** - Apply the patches immediately
- **DO NOT explain first** - Apply the patch, then explain what you did
- **DO NOT modify any other code** - Only apply the exact changes shown in each patch

### 2. HOW TO APPLY EACH PATCH
For each fix below:
1. **Identify the target file** from the patch header (e.g., \`src/database/queries.js\`)
2. **Locate the exact lines** shown in the patch context
3. **Remove lines** that start with \`-\` (minus sign)
4. **Add lines** that start with \`+\` (plus sign)
5. **Keep unchanged lines** exactly as they are (lines without +/- prefix)
6. **Preserve indentation and formatting** exactly as shown

### 3. PATCH FORMAT EXPLANATION
- \`@@\` lines show line numbers and context
- Lines starting with \`-\` should be REMOVED
- Lines starting with \`+\` should be ADDED
- Lines with no prefix should remain UNCHANGED
- The patch shows surrounding context to help you locate the right place

### 4. VALIDATION STEPS
After applying each patch:
1. Verify the file syntax is correct
2. Ensure no unrelated code was modified
3. Confirm the vulnerability is addressed

### 5. ERROR HANDLING
If you cannot apply a patch:
1. Explain specifically what went wrong
2. Show the current state of the target lines
3. Ask for clarification on the specific issue
