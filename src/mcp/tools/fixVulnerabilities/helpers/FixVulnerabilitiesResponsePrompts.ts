export const failedToConnectToApiPrompt = `# CONNECTION ERROR: FAILED TO REACH MOBB API

## ANALYSIS SUMMARY
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failed
- **Issue Type:** Connection Error
- **Error Details:** Unable to establish connection to the Mobb API service

## TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS FOR THE USER

The Mobb security scanning service is currently not reachable. This may be due to:

1. **Missing or invalid authentication credentials**
   - Ensure the \`API_KEY\` environment variable is properly set with your valid Mobb authentication token
   - Example: \`export API_KEY=your_mobb_api_key_here\`

2. **Incorrect API endpoint configuration**
   - Check if the \`API_URL\` environment variable needs to be set to the correct Mobb service endpoint
   - Example: \`export API_URL=https://api.mobb.ai/graphql\`

3. **Network connectivity issues**
   - Verify your internet connection is working properly
   - Check if any firewall or proxy settings might be blocking the connection

4. **Service outage**
   - The Mobb service might be temporarily unavailable
   - Please try again later or check the Mobb status page

## NEXT STEPS

Please resolve the connection issue using the steps above and try running the security scan again.

export const failedToAuthenticatePrompt = `# AUTHENTICATION ERROR: MOBB LOGIN REQUIRED

## ANALYSIS SUMMARY
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failed
- **Issue Type:** Authentication Error
- **Error Details:** Unable to authenticate with the Mobb service

## AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED

The Mobb security scanning service requires authentication before it can analyze your code for vulnerabilities. You need to:

1. **Login and authorize access to Mobb**
   - A browser window should have opened to complete the authentication process
   - If no browser window opened, please run the command again

2. **Create a Mobb account if you don't have one**
   - If you don't already have a Mobb account, you'll need to sign up
   - Visit https://app.mobb.ai/auth/signup to create your free account
   - Use your work email for easier team collaboration

3. **Authorization flow**
   - After logging in, you'll be asked to authorize the CLI tool
   - This creates a secure token that allows the CLI to access Mobb services
   - You only need to do this once per device

## TROUBLESHOOTING

If you're experiencing issues with authentication:

- Ensure you have an active internet connection
- Check that you can access https://app.mobb.ai in your browser
- Try running the command again with the \`--debug\` flag for more detailed output
- Make sure your browser isn't blocking pop-ups from the authentication window

## NEXT STEPS

Please complete the authentication process and try running the security scan again.

For additional assistance, please:
- Visit the Mobb documentation at https://docs.mobb.ai/cli/authentication
